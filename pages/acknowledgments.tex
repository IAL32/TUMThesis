I was 4 years old and a half when I first arrived in Italy. Now, 20 years later (wow), I am completing my journey.
Thanks to everyone who tagged along on my academic journey.
Special thanks to my wonderful and supportive parents Laura and Jos√©; my ``sore'' Valeria, and my girlfriend Iris.
Also, thanks to everyone who has believed in me and who didn't make me quit (you know who you are).
