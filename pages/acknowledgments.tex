Thanks to everyone who tagged along on my academic journey.
A special thanks go to my wonderful and supportive parents Laura and Jos√©; my ``sore'' Valeria, and my girlfriend Iris.
Also, thanks to everyone who has believed in me and who didn't make me quit (you know who you are).
Finally, many thanks to my very patient academic advisor Alexander.
