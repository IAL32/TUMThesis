\section{Focus on effects of the number of peers and vCPUs per peer}

We have seen how different Hivemind configurations can affect training on two peers.
However, it might be useful to dedicate more than two machines to train deep neural networks.
In this section, we answer the following question: what are the effects of scaling up the number of machines when using Hivemind?

The frequency at which peers average their model state is directly proportional to the number of peers, the throughput per second of each peer and the TBS.
In turn, the throughput per second is affected by several factors such as the BS, computational power of the node and wait times for I/O operations.

It might be difficult to isolate the effects of introducing more nodes from scaling the target batch size.
Thus, we decided to fix the target batch size to 1250 for this set of experiments and alter TBS, BS, LR, GAS and LU.

Similar to the Hivemind runs with 2 peers and 8vCPUs presented in \autoref{sec:focus-effect-bs-lr-tbs}, \autoref{fig:runtime-decrease_scale-nop} shows
