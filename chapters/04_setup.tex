\chapter{Setup}\label{chapter:setup}

In this chapter, we describe the requirements for building a suitable environment to run experiments using Hivemind. We further
present a high-level overview of our implementation with a simplified visualization. Finally, we describe in detail the technologies
and resources that we have used to build such as the environment (CEPH, OpenNebula, description of the machines), how we
provision them (Terraform, Ansible, ...).
