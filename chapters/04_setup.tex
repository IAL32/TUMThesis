\chapter{Setup}\label{chapter:setup}

In this chapter, we describe the requirements for building a suitable environment to run experiments using Hivemind. We further
present a high-level overview of our implementation with a simplified visualization. Finally, we describe in detail the technologies
and resources that we have used to build such as the environment (CEPH, OpenNebula, description of the machines), and how we provision them (Terraform, Ansible, ...).

\section{Experimental Setup}

\section{System's Architecture}

The scope of this thesis is to provide insights about using Hivemind in a controlled environment, such as a cluster of devices that a university, company or institution may leave otherwise unused.
